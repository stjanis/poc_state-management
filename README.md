## What is state?

Way to create communication and sharing of data accross components. Creates a certain data structure to represent the apps state that you can read and write.

    { ...currentState } -> action -> { ...newState }

## Why state management matters?

User's action causes changes in components state. The more complex and bigger application - more state changes we need to track.

## Recommended practices

1. Start with react built in state management (local state)
2. Co-locate state - lift up / move down
3. Is prop drilling a problem?
4. Composition
5. Context
6. Look for an external tool

## Recoil demo

    npm i recoil

## Redux toolkit demo

    npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
